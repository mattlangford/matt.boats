# Blog Creation

I've been working on the format for this blog for a little bit. I figured it'd make a good first post!

I'm aiming for a couple things with this:

1. Very simple interface
2. Statically hosted with no javascript
3. Low overhead for writing shortish blogs
4. It's something to do

## Layout
The general idea is that given a set of markdown files (one for each post), a python script (AI generated `make_page.py`) scrapes those files and generates a set of html pages.

I've elected to keep each blog post in the root folder, or (if there is associated data) in folders that follow an arbitrary `001_name` structure.
The website is generated by scraping each of these folders, and convering the markdown to html using the aformentioned script.
The index page is generated by collecting the title from the markdown page and some metadata at the top of the file.


I suspect it will be hard to keep the layout working on different devices and browsers (including light/dark mode). I'll only be testing on Safari on my Mac.

## Hosting
The deployable pages are packaged into the dist/ folder, and pushed to the `deploy` branch on the [repo](https://github.com/mattlangford/matt.boats/tree/deploy).
Github pages knows to watch this branch and will kick off an action to host the data from there.
I managed to set up a custom domain through namecheap and hookup the cname records so it points to the hosted pages. Although to be honest I don't recall exactly how.
